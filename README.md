Important notes for contributors
================================

1) You're free to pull code from wherever you want in this repo,
but no Pull Requests will be accepted into the Master branch.
It is automatically pulled into the live http server and we
don't want people randomly borking it.


2) After making changes, you need to re-run "./rebuild.php",
so that the cached HTML is refreshed and you can see the changes.


3) Everyone would appreciate if you didn't make big changes
without consulting first (like adding a freaking auth system!).
Such things will probably be denied instantly in the future,
the website is secure enough, thank you very much.
